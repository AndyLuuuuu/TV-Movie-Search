TV Movie Search Mobile App

This mobile application is made using Kotlin and Android Studio. <br/>
The code isn't the prettiest, but it was a great learning experience.

Made on the week of January 20th, 2019. Project lasted about a week and a half. <br/>
However, most of the coding was done within the last 3-5 days.

This mobile application uses "The MovieDB" api to fetch information about TV Shows and Movies. <br/>
